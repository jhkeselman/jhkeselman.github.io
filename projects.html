								<h4>Assessing the MMA Intern Programâ€™s Impact on Science</h4>
								<h6f>Fall 2023</h6f>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/iqp.JPG" alt="Project team with sponsors and advisors"></span>I worked in a team of four to develop a database of former interns for the <a href=https://www.mariamitchell.org/ target="_blank">Maria Mitchell Association</a> (MMA), a science education and reseach center in Nantucket, MA.
								We used MMA archives and independent research to develop a list of former interns before distributing a survey to them regarding their accomplishments and career journey.
								We also conducted interviews with select interns to gain a deeper understanding of their experiences at the MMA and beyond.
								As deliverables, we created a final report of our research, and developed infographics to display the quantifiable impact of former MMA interns on the scientific community.</p>

								<h4>Brigham and Women's Hospital Staff Portal</h4>
								<h6>Spring 2023</h6>
<!--								<p>For this project, I worked in a team of ten to create a desktop application for Mass General Brigham and Women's Hospital. We used Agile design methodologies and-->
<!--								software designs patterns to create our Java application; other technology used included JavaFX, MaterialFX, and Figma for UI/UX design, PostgreSQL and AWS RDS for our database support,-->
<!--								and Jira to manage our Agile sprints. </p>-->
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/softenglandingpage.jpg" alt="Log-in Page for our application"></span>For this project, I worked in a team of ten to create a desktop application for Mass General Brigham and Women's Hospital. Using Agile design methodologies to organize our work,
									we implemented a variety of features including pathfinding, a map editor, component movement to allow for moving offices and departments, service request modules, hospital-wide announcements, and instant messaging.
									This application was then presented to hospital representatives to provide them information and ideas about potential features and UI/UX designs for their internal system.</p>

								<h4>Color-sorting Pick-and-Place Robot</h4>
								<h6>Winter 2023</h6>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/3001arm.png" alt="Robotic arm for this project"></span>Along with two other robotics students, I created a MATLAB library to control a 3-DOF robotics arm. Over the course of the project, we implemented forward and inverse kinematics using both position and velocity, and trajectory generation.
								To assist with testing motion control, we also implemented a real-time virtual simulation of the end-effector's motion, with options to generate a variety of
								graphs during movement. </p>
								<p>For our final demonstration, we developed computer vision code to use a free-standing camera to detect a variety of colored balls, and sort them into different locations by color.
								Our robot would continue to run until all objects in the workspace had been correctly sorted, before returning to a standby position. After a successful demonstration of our base functionality,
								we added detection for additional colors as well as non-spherical objects.</p>

								<h4>Multi-robot Escape Room Navigation</h4>
								<h6>Fall 2022</h6>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/2002.jpg" alt="Project team with our robots; I'm standing on the camera's right" height="330"></span>I worked on creating three Romi robots to solve an "Escape Room" maze. Each robot was designed to complete one component of the overall project: locating the escape door and activating the door key, locating and obtaining the door key,
								or opening and driving through the escape door. To do this, we used C++ code to implement a variety of sensors, as well as kinematics and PID control for motion. We developed control code that was also resilient to obstacles or
								unexpected changes in the environment, as our class was the first to complete this project. This resilience in our code helped ensure that all three robots could consistently complete
								their given tasks during final demonstrations.</p>

								<h4>Autonomous Panel Placement Robots</h4>
								<h6>Fall 2022</h6>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/2001.png" alt="Solidworks model of a robot for this course" height="360"></span>I worked with a team to create two robots to autonomously collect and replace solar panels on a model house. Each robot had a unique four-bar linkage arm and gripper assembly,
								giving me experience with mechanical design and analysis. Both robots were required seperate analysis of force and control for the arm and gripper, but they both needed to be able to place collectors
								at two different angles on the house. To ensure that we could efficiently develop our control software and test both robots, I lead the implementation of a single state machine in C++ that would
								allow us to utilize identical code on both robots, with a remote control used to control which arm positions and gripper system to use for each run.
								This highlighted my ability to create creative and optimal software solutions and lead a development team.</p>

								<h4>WPI Esports Lab</h4>
								<h6>Fall 2022</h6>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/esportslab.jpg" alt="WPI Esports Lab"></span>As part of the <a href=https://wpiesports.github.io/ target="_blank">WPI Esports</a> Club Executive Board, I helped design and implement the WPI Esports Lab and Gaming Lounge. These spaces provide students with opportunities to use
								state-of-the-art gaming equipment and get involved with collegiate esports. As Treasurer of the Esports Club, I managed the purchasing of all items for these spaces, and organized
								our final purchase report to the student government financial board for reimbursement approval. As current President, I help oversee the space, and I organize and run a variety of events
								to engage the WPI community. I have also led the growth of the club's tournament offerings.</p>
