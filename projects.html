								<h4>Maria Mitchell Association Internship Database</h4>
								<h6>Fall 2023</h6>
								<p>I worked in a team of four to develop a database of former interns for the Maria Mitchell Association (MMA), a science education and reseach center in Nantucket, MA.
								We used MMA archives and independent research to develop a list of former interns before distributing a survey to them regarding their accomplishments and career journey.
								We also conducted interviews with select interns to gain a deeper understanding of their experiences at the MMA and beyond.
								As deliverables, we created a final report of our research, and developed infographics to display the quantifiable impact of former MMA interns on the scientific community.</p>

								<h4>Brigham and Women's Hospital Staff Portal</h4>
								<h6>Spring 2023</h6>
<!--								<p>For this project, I worked in a team of ten to create a desktop application for Mass General Brigham and Women's Hospital. We used Agile design methodologies and-->
<!--								software designs patterns to create our Java application; other technology used included JavaFX, MaterialFX, and Figma for UI/UX design, PostgreSQL and AWS RDS for our database support,-->
<!--								and Jira to manage our Agile sprints. </p>-->
								<p>For this project, I worked in a team of ten to create a desktop application for Mass General Brigham and Women's Hospital. Using Agile design methodologies to organize our work,
								we implemented a variety of features including pathfinding, a map editor, component movement to allow for moving offices and departments, service request modules, hospital-wide announcements, and instant messaging.
								This application was then presented to hospital representatives to provide them information and ideas about potential features and UI/UX designs for their internal system.</p>

								<h4>Color-sorting Pick-and-Place Robot</h4>
								<h6>Winter 2023</h6>
								<p>Along with two other robotics students, I created a MATLAB library to control a 3-DOF robotics arm. Over the course of the project, we implemented forward and inverse kinematics using both position and velocity, and trajectory generation.
								To assist with testing motion control, we also implemented a real-time virtual simulation of the end-effector's motion, with options to generate a variety of
								graphs during movement. </p>
								<p>For our final demonstration, we developed computer vision code to use a free-standing camera to detect a variety of colored balls, and sort them into different locations by color.
								Our robot would continue to run until all objects in the workspace had been correctly sorted, before returning to a standby position. After a successful demonstration of our base functionality,
								we added detection for additional colors as well as non-spherical objects.</p>
